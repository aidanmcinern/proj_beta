## 1. Project Title and Description
This repositry (proj_beta) holds the files for my personal project site - www.aidanmcinern.com - built as a technical sandbox to try out new tools and techniques outside my usual data science work, including:
- Front-end development in React.
- Blender for 3D modeling and animations.
- Best practice for backend structuring, including Express API
- Database paradigms i'd otherwise only read about like MongoDB and Neo4j.
- DevOps best practices, including security, CI/CD and containerization.

## 2. Features
 the main features of your project. For example:
Interactive 3D elements (Blender integration).
Dynamic visualizations using Plotly.
API integrations showcasing real-world data.
MongoDB and Neo4j database examples.
CI/CD pipeline implementation for seamless deployment.

## 3. Technology Stack
Provide a quick breakdown of the tools and technologies used in the project:
Frontend: React, CSS, HTML.
Backend: Flask, Node.js (or your choice of backend framework).
Databases: MongoDB, Neo4j.
APIs: (List any external APIs you integrated).
DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions (or other CI/CD tools).
Other Tools: Blender, Plotly, Polars.

## 4. Installation and Setup
Prerequisites: List dependencies like Python, Node.js, Docker, etc.
Steps to Clone and Run:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject

# For backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# For frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Environment Variables: Outline any required .env variables (e.g., API keys, database URIs).
## 5. Usage
Include instructions on how to interact with the site or use its features:
How to explore visualizations.
How to access specific sections (e.g., APIs, database examples).
Any interactive functionality (like the "Ask the Bartender" feature).

## 7. Learning Objectives & Outcomes
Share the learning goals you set for yourself through this project (e.g., mastering Kubernetes, integrating new databases, honing frontend skills).

Blender: I had no experience whatsoever, but i found [blenderguru's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru) invaluable to get orientated, as there is a bit of a learning curve. It's pretty intuitive once you reach the plateau and i particularly like the workflow and the flexiblity in creating procedural models. However - and i hate to complain as its open source and generally great - working with armatures drains time away like nothing else - so frustrating!

Kubernetes
